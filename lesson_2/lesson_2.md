### LESSON 2. Dashboard visualization, filters and fields in Tableau.

Today, the plan is to create a full-fledged dashboard, as well as understand which filters exist in Tableau and how to use them.

Imagine that you, as a data analyst, need to present a prepared dashboard to a team of film directors and producers. It should be easy to understand and use, and should clearly reflect the picture of the film industry over the last 20 years. This is exactly what the dashboard and the ability to use filters will help us to quickly display information that will be of interest to the team.
