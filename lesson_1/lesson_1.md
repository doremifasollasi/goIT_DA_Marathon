### LESSON 1. Getting to know the data, creating a visualization in Tableau.

Today we will analyze what a data analyst does, and in practice we will create our first visualization.
Our project is films that either won an award or were nominated for an Oscar film award.

We will start by analyzing the number of films that have been made in the last 20 years. The already prepared database, which you will find in this bot, will help us in this. As a result of the analysis, we will be able to evaluate the film industry market with the help of graphs and charts. So go ahead and create your first visualization!

Your teacher will be Oksana Nosenko, head of the Jooble analytics team üôå
